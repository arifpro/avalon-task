## Problem Statement

Analyze the canvas project files and plan the component design

## Things to consider

- Try to Apply all the react features. (where applicable)
- The price list in the sample canvas project will come from the Redux store.
- The button should generate an alert with the proper form value.
- Implement custom hook where applicable.

## Rules

1. The project should be runnable by yarn start/npm start.
2. If you do not complete the test please indicate how you would intend to finalize it in the README.
3. The team is looking to see how you approach a problem with
   a broad spec which could have a number of different solutions
   and then explain your approach? Keep the implementation simple,
   but make sure you include the component-level testing.
4. We are not expecting the solution to be deployed, but we
   expect you to understand the process and best practices
   around the deployment process. It‚Äôs enough if you could
   provide to our engineers clear and easy instructions on how
   to deploy your application
